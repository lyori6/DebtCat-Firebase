# DebtCat: Webflow to Firebase Migration 🐱💰

## TL;DR
Successfully migrated a debt management web application from Webflow to Firebase under tight budget constraints. Replaced dynamic CMS with static article templates, implemented custom migration scripts, and leveraged AI assistance for development. The migration maintained core functionality while eliminating recurring costs and simplifying the codebase.

## Project Overview
A technical case study of migrating DebtCat from Webflow to Firebase, showcasing how to handle platform dependencies and make strategic technical compromises while maintaining business continuity. This migration transformed a CMS-dependent website into a lightweight, static-first application optimized for maintenance and future scalability.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Migration Scope
- **Platform Migration**: Webflow → Firebase (Free tier)
- **Pages Migrated**: 30+ HTML pages
- **Architecture**: Static-first approach with templated articles
- **Asset Migration**: Custom scripts for content and image transfer

### Current Architecture & Stack
```
Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (Static-first approach)
Hosting: Firebase
Content: Static article templates
Development: AI-assisted coding (Multiple models)
```
